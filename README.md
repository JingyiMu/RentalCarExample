# RentalCarExample
I created some json files for testing. And I use Google GSON library to convert json to a Java object. 

We have three classes for Car:
Metadata
Metrics
PerDayRent
And in the Metrics, there is another class RentalCount. 

For the unit test, in the test package, there are some test cases I created. 

Run App.java to run the project.
